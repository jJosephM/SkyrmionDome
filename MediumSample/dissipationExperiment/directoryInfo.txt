This directory is for testing dynamics with high dissipation (alpha = 2.5, beta = 4.0)

It is NOT for the dynamic relaxation experiment where we try to "relax" the dome by not pushing current and just dissipate the energy

#Results#

The results so far just stretch the dome (again at 30nm) to the end of the sample for u ~ 150

#To DO

Try even higher currents to detect critical phenomena
