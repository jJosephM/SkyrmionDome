This is an attempt to see what happens if we make the film real small ~2x the minimum dome height

#Resuts

Nasty stuff happens to the dome

#To Do

Fiddle around with it:
  Make the dome the full height of the film (60nm)
  Come back to it after results of dynamic relaxation experiment
    Maybe there's something that can be done about the "flattening" that occurs when we make the initial magnetization cylinder too short
