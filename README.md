The Skyrmiond Dome Repository

Just a place to hold some code for a paper on skyrmion domes in thick films

**********Checklist/Plan**********

1)  Double dome height and run current for longer
    a)  Try relaxing the syste after a split has ocurred

2)  Figure out in-slurm script variables to reduce possibility of inconsistent core usage on the cluster

Here's a composite of a dome at various depths
